            An open source project to desmostrate the design of a autonomous
            early fire warning drone system.

                    Some rough estimates say that about 10,000 structures were
                    burned, including 19,970 acres. This just goes to show how
                    fire leniency will lead to costs in some way or another.
                </p>
                <p class="art-text">
                    This project was created to show better ways to use tech to
                    prevent fires, namly via drones. Hopful by going about the
                    design of such a system, future ideas can be made off of it.

                <p class="art-text">
                    I would hate to imagine myself waking up to a half burned
                    city, with my whole life forever changed. Maybe someday such
                    system which rely on clean engery without mannul labbor.

                <p class="art-text">
                    This project details the whole system for making automatic
                    drones. Even to examples of frameworks and server client
                    structure a real counterpart could use.

                <p class="art-text">
                    By making this project we hope to solve the problem of wild
                    fires, via making people aware their is a solution, using
                    mordern technology.
