                        1. What is the main goal of this project?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        The main goal is to design a system using drones to
                        detect wildfires early, minimizing damage and providing
                        a proactive solution through technology.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        2. How do the drones detect wildfires?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        The drones are equipped with sensors such as thermal
                        cameras, air quality monitors, and infrared imaging to
                        detect heat, smoke, and other signs of a wildfire.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        3. What technologies are used in this system?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        The system relies on modern technologies like artificial
                        intelligence for pattern recognition, IoT for real-time
                        communication, and GPS for precise navigation and
                        coverage.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        4. How does this system benefit the environment?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        By using clean energy sources to power drones and
                        reducing manual labor, the system minimizes the
                        environmental footprint while preventing large-scale
                        wildfire damage.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        5. What are the potential challenges of implementing
                        this system?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Challenges include developing cost-effective and
                        reliable drone technology, ensuring scalability, and
                        integrating with existing wildfire management
                        infrastructure.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        6. Is this system fully autonomous?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        The system is designed to operate autonomously but may
                        require periodic human oversight for maintenance,
                        updates, and complex decision-making scenarios.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        7. Can this system prevent all wildfires?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        While it aims to detect and respond to wildfires early,
                        it cannot prevent natural causes such as lightning
                        strikes. However, it significantly reduces the spread
                        and impact of fires.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
                        8. What makes drones better suited for this task than
                        other methods?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Drones offer flexibility, can cover large and
                        hard-to-reach areas quickly, and provide real-time data
                        without risking human lives.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question">
